     * protocol doesn't fit the generic shape — for example:

     *  - An MCP `Elicitation` event with a non-standard request/response.
     *  - Gemini CLI's `decision: "ask"` punt-to-native-prompt, which
     *    needs a third response branch alongside allow/deny.
     *  - A websocket / stdio-piped harness that doesn't terminate at
     *    Belay's HTTP server at all.
     *  - An OAuth callback or registration-completion endpoint.
     *
     * Custom overrides can:
     *  - Call `super.installRoutes(routing, deps)` to keep the standard
     *    routes and add additional ones.
     *  - Skip the generic call entirely and install a fully bespoke
     *    handler graph.
     *
     * `installRoutes` is invoked exactly once per server start, inside
     * Ktor's `routing { }` block, so all the standard routing-DSL
     * extensions are available.
